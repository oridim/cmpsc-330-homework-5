// Description:
//
// 
//The code implements a strategic player for the game "Dots and Boxes" 
//that evaluates the game board and selects moves based on a defined strategy. 
//It prioritizes completing boxes to score points, avoids moves that might 
//give the opponent an advantage, and uses a priority queue to handle critical 
//opportunities, such as completing boxes with three lines. Additionally, it
//dynamically updates its internal board state based on game events and uses 
//a fallback random selection when no strategic moves are available, ensuring 
//the player remains competitive throughout the game.
